# Ollama Web UI Lite 🦙

Ollama Web UI Lite is a streamlined version of [Ollama Web UI](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui), designed to offer a simplified user interface with minimal features and reduced complexity. The primary focus of this project is on achieving cleaner code through a full TypeScript migration, adopting a more modular architecture, ensuring comprehensive test coverage, and implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline.

## Features ⭐

The current version includes only the essential functionalities found in the full [Ollama Web UI](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui), such as pulling and deleting models, engaging in conversations with one or multiple models, chat import/export, etc.

- **Code Cleanup:** Enhance readability and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Architectural Refactoring:** Implement a more modular architecture with a focus on component separation.
- **TypeScript Migration:** Fully migrate the codebase to TypeScript, providing complete type declarations.
- **Test Implementation:** Introduce a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure code reliability.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
